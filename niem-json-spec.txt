Table of Contents

   The table of contents is omitted from this edition.

1. Introduction

   This document establishes methods and rules for using NIEM with JSON.

2. Terminology

   This document uses terminology from other specifications. This section enumerates this externally-defined terminology.

2.1. IETF Best Current Practice 14 terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14] [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2.2. Conformance Targets Attribute Specification

   [CTAS] defines several terms used normatively within this specification.

   The term conformance target is defined by [CTAS] Section 3.1, Conformance Target Defined which states:

      A conformance target is a class of artifact, such as an interface, protocol, document, platform, process or service, that is the subject of conformance clauses and normative statements. There may be several conformance targets defined within a specification, and these targets may be diverse so as to reflect different aspects of a specification. For example, a protocol message and a protocol engine may be different conformance targets.

   The term conformance target identifier is defined by [CTAS] Section 3.1, Conformance Target Defined, which states:

      A conformance target identifier is an internationalized resource identifier that uniquely identifies a conformance target.

   The term effective conformance target identifier is defined by [CTAS] Section 4, Semantics and Use, which states:

      An effective conformance target identifier of a conformant document is an internationalized resource identifier reference that occurs in the document's effective conformance targets attribute.

2.3. JSON

2.4. JSON-LD

   [JSON-LD] defines the term JSON-LD document at [JSON-LD] Section 7, Data Model.

3. Conformance Targets

3.1. JSON document

   The conformance target JSON document uses code JSON.

4. Conformance of a JSON document to a NIEM IEPD

   A JSON document MAY be conformant to any number of NIEM IEPDs.

4.1. Strict conformance to an IEPD

   A JSON document is strictly conformant to an IEPD if and only if it contains only the content as described by an NIEM-conformant XML Schema set.

4.2. Lax conformance to an IEPD

   A JSON document is laxly conformant to an IEPD if and only if it contains the content required by an NIEM-conformant XML Schema set, and MAY include other content not specified by the NIEM-conformant XML Schema set.

5. Rules

Rule 5-1. File must be a JSON-LD file

   [Rule 5-1] (JSON)

      The file MUST be a JSON-LD file.
